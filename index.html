                The anonymous graffiti artist known as Banksy is perhaps the
                most controversial street artist of today. He is famous for his
                stenciled graffiti works, which appear in public spaces around
                the world. His use of stenciling developed from a need to
                complete a work quickly, namely to avoid being caught
                vandalizing by police. Banksy often uses multi-layered stencils
                to employ multiple colors, and he frequently incorporates
                permanent environmental fixtures, such as street signs and
                architectural elements, into his work. Marked by dark humor,
                satire, and political commentary, much of his street art has
                become viral on the Internet. His most notable early work was
                the result of a trip to Palestine and the West Bank, where he
                stenciled nine images on the Bethlehem Wall <br /><br />
                Despite his stealth presence, Banksy has become a mainstream
                phenomenon. In 2010 Banksy directed Exit Through the Gift Shop,
                a chronicle of the underground world of street art, which was
                nominated for Best Documentary at the Oscars. In 2015, he opened
                Dismaland Bemusement Park, a temporary exhibition of an
                inverted, dystopian Disneyland. Although Banksy has continuously
                emphasized an aversion to the art world through his output, he
                also produces traditional works on canvas and prints as well as
                branded merchandise such as t-shirts. His cultural significance,
                widespread popularity, and, certainly, the mystery of his
                identity have all contributed to the desirability of his art.
                According to Sothebyâ€™s Mei Moses, the average compound annual
                return for Banksy is 8.5%, with 76.5% of works increasing in
                value.
